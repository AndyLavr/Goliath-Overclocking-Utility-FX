## How it works
The Goliath Overclocking utility uses custom made Java classes which utilize the Goliath Terminal class by pushing(setting) and pulling(getting) Nvidia Settings attributes.
This application creates an app folder in your home folder in order to store app settings, GPU info, and fan profiles.

The classes can be found [here](https://github.com/BlueGoliath/GoliathOCBackend) and the Terminal class can be found [here](https://github.com/BlueGoliath/Goliath-Terminal)
